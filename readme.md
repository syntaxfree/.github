# What

Syntaxfree is collection of projects exploring idea of editing code using AST only.

Syntax is seen as irrelevant artifact of serialization of code for storage.

Language server process "owns" code content, making editor a thin proxy only for UI purpose.

Wide adoption of code formatters shows we don't want artistic bracket placement and syntaxfree takes this one step ahead.
